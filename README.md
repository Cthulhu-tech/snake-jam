Supreme Cosmic Communist Snake!

The Supreme Cosmic Communisssst Snake is a physics-based action arcade game made with Phaser 3 and TypeScript.
You play as a cosmic communist snake fighting eagles and destroying capitalist idols — burgers, cola, and greed — in the depths of space.

Each shot is a step toward freedom. But the eagle watches from above, ready to strike. React quickly in QTE battles — or lose a piece of your serpentine soul.
Survive and keep moving forward. With every level, the caves grow wider, chaos stronger, and the snake — more powerful.

Controls
Action: Aiming — Mouse movement → Choose the direction of your shot.
Action: Shot — Hold and release mouse button → Launch the snake using physical force.
Action: Power Bar — Spacebar → Locks the strike power in the mini-game.
Action: Eagle Attack (QTE) — Press shown letters → Hit all letters before the timer runs out.
Action: Break Trash — Collision → Destroy cola cans and burgers by smashing into them.
Action: Goal — Reach the black hole → Complete the level and move to the next one.

Long live the Cosmic Revolution!
